            <p style="font-size: large; color: purple; text-align: center;">Human anatomy is the study of the structures of the human body. An understanding of anatomy is key to the practice of medicine and other areas of health.</p>
            <p style="font-size: large; color: purple; text-align: center;">Human anatomy encompasses a close study into the organization of the human body. There is a hierarchy in this organization: from simple cells to complex organ systems. The human body can be divided into body region such as the back and trunk, the head and neck, and the upper and lower members. When conducting a study of the human body, an individual is in the anatomical position. This means the body is erect with the arms on the side and the head facing forward. The direction or point of view of the body can be anterior, posterior, proximal or distal.</p>
            <p style="font-size: large; color: purple; text-align: center;">The human anatomy is a complex structure made of many body tissues, organ systems and other body structures to ensure all the basic body functions occur with precision. The constituents of these systems are less complex but it is in these simpler units that basic body processes occur.</p>
